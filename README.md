## Repository Description
In every TPC{x} folder a new theme is studied in theory and the folder LAB{x+1} will contain the practical aplication (aka mini-project) of that theme.

## Grades
The grade is given to a theme where 50% of the grade is from the TPC and the other 50% is from the lab.

Markov chains (HW + lab): hw = 7.5, lab = 10 final grade = 17.5/20 <br/>
(Markov decision problems)	Markov decision problems (HW + lab): hw = 6, lab = 9.8 final grade = 15.8/20<br/>
(POMDPs)	Partially observable MDPs (HW + lab):<br/>
(supervised learning)	Supervised learning (HW + lab):<br/>
(reinforcement learning)	Reinforcement learning (HW + lab):<br/>
